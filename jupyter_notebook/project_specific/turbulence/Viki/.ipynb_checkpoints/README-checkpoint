This folder contains 20 snapshots of water surface, wind velocity, and pressure data from the wind wave simulation.
The velocities are in the lab frame of reference. To transform into the wave frame of reference one can simply subtract 1.00249 from all the u data and keep v the same.

In the illustration plot:
The color is showing the v component of the velocity.
The black line is the water surface.
The velocities (u,v) are sampled at the dashed line, about 1/8 wave length from the mean water surface.
The pressure is sampled at the dotted line.

Not important (yet) context information about the simulation: wave age c/u_* = 4.
