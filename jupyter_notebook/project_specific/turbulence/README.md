### Structure of the post-processing code

#### Python scripts
* def.py defines the Case and the Interface2D classes
* phase.py defines the extract_phase function that reads in each interface file and extract the phase (and limited amount of fields)

#### Jupyter notebook
* Pressure is the main file that defines the various cases and time sequence
